Description: ThreadWeaver library to help multithreaded programming.in Qt
 ThreadWeaver is a helper for multithreaded programming. It uses a job-based
 interface to queue tasks and execute them in an efficient way.  You simply
 divide the workload into jobs, state the dependencies between the jobs and
 ThreadWeaver will work out the most efficient way of dividing the work between
 threads within a set of resource limits.
